# Mod_15_CitiBike_Tableau_Challenge

# Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to help investors decide if a bike-sharing program is a worthy investment in Des Moines, Iowa. This analysis breaks down citibike data to better understand the target customer to help get this business off the ground and running.

## Results
The data consistently shows that men are frequent users of ridesharing bikes.

![Males_Take_Most_Trips.png](https://github.com/tylerwe19/Mod_15_Tableau_Challenge/blob/main/Males_Take_Most_Trips.PNG)
As seen in the above donut chart, 65% of trips taken on the ride sharing bikes are males.

The above shows that are consistently the predominant user of ridesharing bikes, with usage peaking on Thursdays.

This is another visualization showing males frequent usage of ridesharing bikes. This visualization helps us see that they typically use it going to and from work.


![Most_Frequent_Trip_Duration.png](https://github.com/tylerwe19/Mod_15_Tableau_Challenge/blob/main/Most_Frequent_Trip_Duration.PNG)
This next visualization helps us understand the length of trip customers predominantly take. The most frequent length of trip males take are 5 minute trips.


![Avg_Duration_And_Trip_Count.png](https://github.com/tylerwe19/Mod_15_Tableau_Challenge/blob/main/Avg_Duration_And_Trip_Count.PNG)
This is another visualization showing that males use the ridesharing bikes much more frequently than females, but males average trip is shorter. 


From this analysis we can see that ridesharing bikes are predominantly used by men to go to and from work.


#### Below are additional visualizations to help the company monitor bike usage.

![Minutes_Trips_On_Each_Bike.png](https://github.com/tylerwe19/Mod_15_Tableau_Challenge/blob/main/Minutes_Trips_On_Each_Bike.PNG)
This visualization will help the company monitor bike usage. It shows the total minutes each bike has been ridden and the number of trips it has taken. This will be a way management can monitor the life of a bike and decide when to refresh their inventory.



![Trips_Over_3_Hrs.png](https://github.com/tylerwe19/Mod_15_Tableau_Challenge/blob/main/Trips_Over_3_Hrs.PNG)
This is another fun visualization that shows trips that lasted over 3 hours. If the goal of a future marketing campaign would be to convince customers to go on longer trips, then this group would be interesting to further explore.


### Summary
This analysis shows that a strategy to get this new investment up and running is to market ridesharing bikes to men as a quick mode of transporation to get to and from work.

 1. It would be cool to create a spider graph to show where bikes have gone. 
 2. It would be nice to have more data and to see if certain times throughout the year are peak times of interest for ridesharing bikes.
